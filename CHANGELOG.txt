Version: 1.0.1, 18 Mar 2018:
- Fixes the formatting issue with shipping options when multiple choices are available.
- New page scripts (jscript_addr_pulldowns_zca_bootstrap.php) have been created to provide template-specific rendering if the bootstrap template is current. The css classes in these files will now use the BS classes.
- An additional file (/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/bootstrap/zca_bootstrap_id.php) is added. That file contains a single definition, the presence of which identifies the template as bootstrap or a clone. Support for the Clone a Template plugin. 

Version: 1.0.2, 26 Mar 2018:
- Updated so the Clone a Template plugin can be used.
- Replace page specific jscript_addr_pulldowns.php files with jscript_addr_pulldowns_zca_bootstrap.php to include bootstrap classes.
- Update tpl_checkout_shipping_default.php to address a formatting issue.
- Update "/includes/templates/bootstrap/" tpl_modules_create_account.php, tpl_contact_us_default.php, tpl_modules_address_book_details.php, tpl_modules_checkout_new_address.php, tpl_modules_checkout_new_shipping_address.php, tpl_modules_checkout_new_payment_address.php to address a formatting issue with drop-downs. This update also places the "required indicator" right of the drop-down label.
- Update "/includes/languages/english/bootstrap/" document_general_info.php, document_product_info.php, product_free_shipping_info.php, product_info.php, product_music_info.php to reword "Larger Images" to "Additional Images".
- Update "/includes/templates/bootstrap/modalboxes/" tpl_bootstrap_images.php so the Main Image thumb and Additional Images thumbs are same size.
- Update "includes/templates/bootstrap/common" tpl_offcanvas_menu.php so the more_information drop-down adheres to the EZ-Pages Display Status - Sidebox configuration.
